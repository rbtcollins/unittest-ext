===========

``assertSameElements`` does not silence Py3k warnings as this uses
``warnings.catch_warnings()`` which is new in Python 2.6 (and is used as a
context manager which would be a pain to make work with Python 2.4).

TestCase instances now have a dictionary of instance methods setup for the
typeEquality functions. This means that TestCase instances are no longer
pickleable. This is solved in Python 2.7 with fixes to the deepcopy module
that are present in Python 2.6 onwards.
