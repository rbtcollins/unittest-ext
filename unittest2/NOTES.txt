Differences
===========

``assertSameElements`` does not silence Py3k warnings as this uses
``warnings.catch_warnings()`` which is new in Python 2.6 (and is used as a
context manager which would be a pain to make work with Python 2.4).

TestCase instances now have a dictionary of instance methods setup for the
typeEquality functions. This means that TestCase instances are no longer
pickleable. This is solved in Python 2.7 with fixes to the deepcopy module.

This is fixable by only storing names in the type equality function dictionary
and doing magic in __setitem__ and __getitem__.


``TestCase.longMessage`` defaults to True because it is better. It defaults to
False in Python 2.7 for backwards compatibility reasons.

``python -m package`` doesn't work until Python 2.7, to provide the command line
features a ``unit2.py`` script is provided instead.
