Can't be backported to Python 2.3 as it uses decorators.


Differences
===========

``assertSameElements`` does not silence Py3k warnings as this uses
``warnings.catch_warnings()`` which is new in Python 2.6 (and is used as a
context manager which would be a pain to make work with Python 2.4).

The underlying dictionary storing the type equality functions on TestCase is a
custom object rather than a real dictionary. This allows TestCase instances to
be deep-copyable on Python versions prior to 2.7.

``TestCase.longMessage`` defaults to True because it is better. It defaults to
False in Python 2.7 for backwards compatibility reasons.

``python -m package`` doesn't work until Python 2.7, to provide the command line
features a ``unit2`` (and ``unit2.py``) script is provided instead.
